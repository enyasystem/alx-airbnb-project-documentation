# 🏗️ Airbnb Clone Backend: Features & Functionalities

This document provides a visual and descriptive overview of the **backend features and architecture** for the ALX Airbnb Clone project. It highlights the key modules, their responsibilities, and how they interact to support a fully functional booking platform.

## 📌 Overview

The backend is structured around four major service modules:

1. 🔐 **User Authentication**
2. 🏠 **Property Management**
3. 📆 **Booking System**
4. 💳 **Payments Integration**

These modules interact with each other via API calls and persist data in dedicated databases. The system is designed to mimic the backend architecture of real-world booking platforms like Airbnb.
